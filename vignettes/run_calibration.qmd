## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#turn off scientific notation so numbers with decimals are printed
options(scipen = 999)

#only packages that are needed as loaded, functions from other packages are called directly as dplyr::filter
# List of packages for session
.packages = c("parallel","doSNOW")
#install.packages(.packages, dependencies = TRUE)
# Load packages into session 
lapply(.packages, require, character.only=TRUE)


devtools::load_all()

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
